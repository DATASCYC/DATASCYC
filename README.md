👋 Hey, I’m Abhratanu

Business Intelligence Analyst | Insight Builder | Process Fixer | Data Storyteller | Dog Lover 🐶

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!
I’m someone who genuinely enjoys turning complex, messy business challenges into clean, intuitive, data-powered solutions. Whether it’s dashboards, analytics, or process design, my mission is simple:

Make data feel human. Make decisions feel easy. Make work feel smoother.

🔥 What I Do (and Actually Love Doing)

. Build dashboards that explain themselves
. Turn raw data into insights people actually use
. Optimise workflows so teams save hours, not minutes
. Translate business chaos into user stories, BRDs & process flows
. Develop predictive models that guide smarter decisions
. Bring stakeholders, ideas, and tech teams into alignment ⚡
I’ve worked across EdTech, e-commerce, biotech, nonprofits, and community organisations, always with a focus on impact and clarity.
